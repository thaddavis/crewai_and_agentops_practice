**Song Title:** "Own It All"

**Verse 1:**  
(Soft piano intro)  
Yeah, I’ve walked these streets, felt the weight on my soul,  
Every choice I made, it’s part of the whole.  
In the mirror’s reflection, I see my true face,  
Gotta take a step back, gotta find my place.  

**Chorus:**  
(Upbeat rhythm kicks in)  
I own my mistakes, every scar, every fall,  
No more running away, I’m standing tall.  
When the truth comes knockin’, I won’t hesitate,  
I’ll face the music, it’s never too late.  
Yeah, I own it all, I’m ready to stand,  
With my heart on my sleeve, take my life in my hands.  

**Verse 2:**  
(Beat picks up)  
It’s a hard road, babe, but I’m not afraid,  
Learning from the shadows where I once stayed.  
With every step forward, I embrace my fate,  
No more pointing fingers, I’ll carry my weight.  

**Chorus:**  
I own my mistakes, every scar, every fall,  
No more running away, I’m standing tall.  
When the truth comes knockin’, I won’t hesitate,  
I’ll face the music, it’s never too late.  
Yeah, I own it all, I’m ready to stand,  
With my heart on my sleeve, take my life in my hands.  

**Bridge:**  
(Soft, inspiring)  
And when the storm comes, I won’t hide in the rain,  
I’ll dance in the downpour, I’ll learn from the pain.  
With every lesson learned, I’ll rise up again,  
Total accountability is where my strength begins.  

**Chorus:**  
I own my mistakes, every scar, every fall,  
No more running away, I’m standing tall.  
When the truth comes knockin’, I won’t hesitate,  
I’ll face the music, it’s never too late.  
Yeah, I own it all, I’m ready to stand,  
With my heart on my sleeve, take my life in my hands.  

**Outro:**  
(Building up)  
Yeah, I own it all, no shadows, no lies,  
I’m taking back my power; watch me touch the skies.  
Every step, every choice, it’s my time to shine,  
Total accountability is the power of mine.
